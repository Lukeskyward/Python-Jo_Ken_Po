# Python-Jo_Ken_Po
This is a simple implementation of the Jo Ken Po game that I made at the beginning of my Python 3 course.

How to Play:
The game is played between the player and the computer.
The player chooses their move by entering a number corresponding to their choice:
0: Rock
1: Paper
2: Scissors
The computer randomly selects its move.
The game follows the usual rules of Jo Ken Po:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
The game displays the chosen moves and determines the winner.
After each game, the player can choose to play again or quit.

Customization:
Currently, the game is implemented with the options 'Rock', 'Paper', and 'Scissors'.
You can customize the moves and their corresponding numbers by modifying the item tuple in the code.
Additionally, you can modify the colors used for displaying game messages by editing the colorama.Fore instances in the code.
